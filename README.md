# Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the risk of cervical cancer using a machine learning model. The model is deployed via a Flask web application, where users can input specific medical and lifestyle factors to receive a prediction of their cancer risk. The model has been trained on a dataset containing various features related to cervical cancer risk factors.

## Features

- **Web Interface**: An easy-to-use interface for users to enter their data and receive predictions.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The model uses specific features like Schiller, Hinselmann, Citology, and others to predict the risk.
- **Audio Feedback**: The app provides audio feedback based on the prediction outcome.
- **Responsive Design**: The web app is designed to be accessible on various devices.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Data Handling**: NumPy, Pickle

## Model Details

The machine learning model used for this project is trained on a dataset of medical records, including features such as:

- **Schiller Test**: Visual examination using iodine solution.
- **Hinselmann Test**: Colposcopy procedure.
- **Citology**: Pap smear test results.
- **STDs History**: History of sexually transmitted diseases.
- **Hormonal Contraceptives**: Use and duration of hormonal contraceptives.
- **Smoking Habits**: Smoking history and duration.
- **IUD Use**: Use of intrauterine devices.
- **Age**: Patient's age.

The model predicts the risk of cervical cancer as either "Positive" or "Negative."

## Outputs

Below are some example outputs from the prediction model:
